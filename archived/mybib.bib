abstract = {Monitoring business cycles faces two potentially conflicting objectives: accuracy and time-
liness. To strike a balance between the dual objectives, we develop a Bayesian sequential
quickest detection method to identify turning points in real time and propose a sequential
stopping time as a solution. Using four monthly indexes of real economic activity in the US,
we evaluate the method's real-time ability to date the past five recessions. The proposed
method identifies similar turning point dates as the National Bureau of Economic Research
(NBER), with no false alarms, but on average dates peaks 4-5 months faster and troughs 12
months faster relative to the NBER announcement.},
