    <h3>Of Chance</h3>

  <div class="three first", align=justify>
    <p>There is no such thing as a chance: anything that should happen will happen, and it only happens once. The so-called random events are due to human's inability to foresee. If you throw a coin, and the physics lead it to land face up, you get a head, or otherwise a tail: What is random? We might think it is random because we cannot tell how physics works since it is too complicated. Hence, the chance is subjective; it does not pertain to natural causes, but the limitation of human cognition. </p>
