    <p>Monitoring recessions is inherently a problem of sequential statistical decision making: upon each arrival of data, a decision is made to either announce the onset of recession or recovery or no sufficient evidence to suggest so. Such decisions will incur two risks: false alarm and delayed detection. The decision-maker will need to strick a balance to achieve optimality. 
    We developed a monitoring schema that consists of the probability of recession or recovery and a sequential decision function that minimizes the decision-maker's loss function.</p>
