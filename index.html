     </p>

<p>Abstract:  Structural breaks are pervasive among macroeconomic and financial time series; consequently, forecasts may lose accuracy out of sample, which renders monitoring structural breaks a critical practice. We develop a structural break monitoring schema, Bayesian Sequential Probability Test (BSPT), for dynamic regression models, which consists of two components: the probabilistic detecting statistics of a structural break, and a sequential stopping procedure. We demonstrate the finite sample property and effectiveness of BSPT by comparing its performance with that of CUSUM under a variety of DGPs and in a few economic applications.</p>
