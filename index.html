      <p><a>Monitoring Recessions: A Bayesian Sequential Quickest Detection Method (forthcoming),</a> with Xuguang s. Sheng and Jingyun Yang, <em>International Journal of Forecasting</em></p>
      <p>Monitoring business cycles faces two potentially conflicting objectives: accuracy and timeliness. To strike a balance between the dual objectives, we develop a Bayesian sequential quickest detection method to identify turning points in real time and propose a sequential stopping time as a solution. Using four monthly indexes of real economic activity in the US, we evaluate the method's real-time ability to date the past five recessions. The proposed method identifies similar turning point dates as the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), with no false alarms, but on average dates peaks 4 months faster and troughs 10 months faster relative to the NBER announcement. The timeliness of our method is also notable compared to the dynamic factor Markov-switching model -- the average lead time is about 5 months in dating peaks and 2 months in dating troughs.</p>
      <h4>Working Paper</h4>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/ethorondor/ethorondor.github.io/blob/master/BSPT.pdf" class="more">Monitoring Structural Breaks in Dynamic Regression Models with Bayesian Sequential Probability Test</a></p>
      <p>Abstract:  Structural breaks are pervasive among macroeconomic and financial time series; consequently, forecasts may lose accuracy out of sample, which renders monitoring structural breaks a critical practice. We develop a structural break monitoring schema, Bayesian Sequential Probability Test (BSPT), for dynamic regression models, which consists of two components: the probabilistic detecting statistics of a structural break, and a sequential stopping procedure. We demonstrate the finite sample property and effectiveness of BSPT by comparing its performance with that of CUSUM under a variety of DGPs and in a few economic applications.</p>

      <p>Abstract: The COVID-induced recession began in March 2020 for the United States. We identify this turning point by applying a sequential quickest detection method to a real-time index of economic activity. Supporting evidence is also found from macroeconomic data releases and stock markets.</p>
